<!-- TITLE: Uhomb 2019 -->

## What worked well
- good amount of affiliate engagement leading up to the sale
- prelaunch campaign was well received and resulted in a lot of opt-ins
- CS keeping on top of everything
- sales page conversions were good
- 27% purchasers also went through prelaunch
- cheat sheet and upsell both went quite well
- gifting worked well 


## What didn't work well
- running behind schedule 
- database issue that caused the system to fall over
- low website traffic
- number of affiliates didn't seem to be receiving our emails
- sending emails to everyone may cause the emails to be ignored more frequently which has flow on effects
- not sure how effective the pre-launch campaign was
- lost a few big contributors that left a noticable hole in our audience
- new affiliates are confused about post affiliate pro's reporting
- weekend bonus may have been a bit too much to talk about / confusing the messaging 
- didn't get to test out the new hero section design
- some of our audience were upset that we had a faith component and a faith upsell
- not sure the bundle counter was visible enough to do what we want it to do
- other contributors running promotions right up until the bundle launch
- bundle content may be getting too broad
- surveyed people who didn't buy
- people haven't used all the content from last year
- training for affiliates on how to allow people to opt out of the bundle promotions
- 

## What we need to change next time
- active push to drive more contributors 
- tweak affiliate portal reports / layout to be more user friendly
- hunt bigger affiliates
- test out a new hero section design
- functionality to "heart" products - nominate their favourites.  Access area could highlight the combined value of the products.
- Add category value to sales page
- quick screen cast that shows how to use the various reporting and link features
- create a start here
- look at what we're doing and change it
- add "why do you hate us" exit pop
- change bundle schedule so we're not running the same bundle every year
