## Mandi Handi Over
- Steph to work on job description
- Get job description out as soon as possible
- Do a few interviews to get infomation out of Mandi's head

- Need to have a grasp on marketing 
- Need to know how to motivate affiliates and "tell the story"
- The person will probably need to be a blogger and have affiliate marketing training
- Action: Mandi to write up her major jobs / description
- Mandi to write down all her pipedreams / long time goals that she was working towards.  A kind of roadmap.
