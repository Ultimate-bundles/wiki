<!-- TITLE: Style Guide -->

This style guide is a simple explanation of the practices and approach to use when writing articles for the Ultimate Bundles wiki.  Following these guides will ensure the wiki formatting remains constant creating a more useable and maintainable resource.

Plain English works best.  Try to avoid complex terminology or jargon.

Formatting of articles should be consistent across the wiki and within any single article.  Read the guidelines below and review a couple of articles to get the feel for when to use headers, text formatting and links.
# Headings 
Only capitalize the first letter of any heading.  The first heading should always be H1.  Any subheadings under that should be H2, then H3.  Do not jump from H1 to H3 or straight into a H2.

# Subject organization
Start articles with a brief introduction.  This can be under the `<!-- TITLE: -->` or under a H1.
