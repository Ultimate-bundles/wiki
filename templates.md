# What's a hub?
A hub is a little like a page, and a little like a folder. It contains pages inside it (like a folder), but also can have contents just like a regular page. Hubs are useful because when looking at another page, if that page is inside a folder with a hub, you can easily go up one tier to that hub with a single click. Without a hub, navigation can be a little trickier.

# What should be on this page?
A hub is most useful when it behaves a bit like a table of contents, or an index of the pages it contains. This example hub follows all the regular "rules" detailed in the [Article Example](/templates/article-template), but also lists information about the templates in this folder, just like a hub should.

# Folder Contents
This folder contains the following pages:

**[The Article Template](/templates/article-template)** shows how an article might look and feel. Articles document things, describing what it is, how it works, and how to use it. 

**[The Process Template](/templates/process-template)** shows how a process should be documented. Processes list specific actions to take in order to make something happen.

**[The Notes Template](/templates/notes-template)** shows how you might record meeting notes, minutes, or some other archive of an event.

**[The Syntax Examples](/templates/syntax-examples)** shows how to use common features of markdown for formatting your work.
