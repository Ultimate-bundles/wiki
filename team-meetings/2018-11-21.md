## Real Plans
They're importing our recipes
Make an upsell page
Two buttons on the upsell page - we'll take their order forms.
Put together emails for someone who buys but doesn't take the upsell
Offer one webinar during live bundle week for everyone who signed up for trial
Same webinar a week after
To get purchase information back from RealPlans we need some kind of message sent back - they can send us a csv.
