# Flash sale details & practices
We run flash sales for every major bundle (ultimate and super bundles).  The flash sale typically happens several months after the original sale, but this varies depending on the sale and what other events are happening during the time of the year.  Check the promotional calendar (pinned to the General Slack channel) for specifics.

These are the typical patterns of a flash sale:

**Duration:** 2 days
**Start:** Midnight on a Sunday
**Finish:** Midnight on Tuesday - but we'll turn the timer back 3 hours at midnight EST for the PST crowd and then let the sale stay open until 8am with the timer showing 00:00:00.
**Testing:** Someone will turn the sale on at 11pm EST and we'll do an hour of purchase and content accuracy testing.   [SweetProcess document will go here once it's completed].
