To link to another Wiki page, you can just enter it's address (folder structure and page address):

# Images
You can add images using the **Insert Image** tool in the page editor, which will allow you to upload a file to the wiki server, and retrieve it later. However, all this does is provide a way of hosting the image, and then linking to it. That is, you do not *have* to use this method. If the image is already hosted somewhere else, you can simply link to it.
