# Major Section 1
A description of this section, what it's for and why it's important. Any overarching ideas about this topic, which serves as an introduction to any subsections included.

Sections and subsections can be linked to directly from other articles, so it's important to use them, but not too much.

This major section uses the H1 syntax.

## Subsection 1
Details about this idea. *Ideally*, every heading will have plain text to follow it immediately. This helps break up the article a bit, give space, and make it easier to read. Without that, it can look like a list of bullet points and be difficult to follow.

This subsection uses the H2 syntax.

You can use additional subsections (up to H3) but it tends to make the article a little disorganized. Most ideas should be able to be displayed using just H1 and H2 headers, as shown in this example article.

Instead of using an H3, consider using multiple paragraphs, bullet points, or italics to add interest and variety.

Subsections should be used carefully and sparingly. Too many and the organization of the article becomes difficult to see. The more information you put under each major section and subsection, the better the article will look.

## Subsection 2

## Subsection 3
