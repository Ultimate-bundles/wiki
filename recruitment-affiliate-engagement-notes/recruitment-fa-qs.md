# Recruitment Policies
Products should not be available for free as a lead magnet, but they don't have to be for sale either. (Launching a brand new or exclusive product in the bundle is a great way to promote the bundle to the contributor's audience.)

Contributors like to submit eCourses to try to get those registrations, but it's important that we don't go overboard with the ecourse registrations. If an ecourse is really just text (like chapters from a book broken down into individual lessons), then we lean toward not including it unless it's a really valuable contributor.

When someone submits a product like that or tries to submit a registration link for an ebook or printable, I will ask if they want to resubmit the product in ebook format (for text content) and explain that "to protect the customer experience, we have to limit 3rd party registrations. For this reason, we reserve those for high-value and/or multimedia ecourses."

I have not perfected this process, but ideally your process will look something like: 

- Send recruitment emails to cold prospects, product applications & top contributors
- Confirm top contributors first 
- Review all products, designating them as strong yeses, maybe & nos
- Confirm the strong yeses
- Confirm maybes to fill in the gaps
- Research more if needed to fill gaps
- Let the nos down gently :)
