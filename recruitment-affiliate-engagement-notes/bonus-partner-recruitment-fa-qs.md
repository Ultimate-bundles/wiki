# Bonus Partner Policies
Bonus must be "no strings attached"—a customer must be able to redeem the bonus *without* an additional purchase. 

The only time we've made exception to this is with Grove, where customers receive $30 in free product (more than is available with a traditional new customer offer) with their first purchase.

Bonus partners (BPs) may only charge bundle customers standard shipping on their bonus offer, i.e. if it normally costs $5 to ship a Gidget, then bundle customers should only pay $5 shipping to get their free Gidget.

When a bonus partner offers ALL customers free shipping, we do allow them to add a base "handling fee" to cover standard shipping for the product, but this should be between $4-7, not an inflated price.

It's important to check the cost of shipping before confirming a bonus partner. Some companies charge a high standard shipping fee, and experience shows that customers get frustrated if shipping in the U.S. is much over $7.50.

Look for bonus partners that will ship to Canada and/or internationally.

Bonuses should be available for new & existing customers. 

This gets tricky for subscription services, either monthly boxes or digital subscriptions. In those cases, we will allow bonus partners to provide a separate offer *of equal value* for existing customers. 

We do sometimes make exceptions to this—Scribd is an example—although the preference would be to have enough bonus applications that we can choose ones that meet the requirement.

The minimum value for physical bonuses is $15. The minimum value for digital bonuses is $30. 

On the bonus partner tiers, you'll see that the platinum spot is reserved for 1 bonus partner who can offer a bonus at double that value ($30 / $60) and pays an affiliate commission on bonus redemptions.

Each tier offers a different level of promotion: the silver tier is our standard tier from years past, while the gold includes extra emails, higher placement, etc.

Bronze bonuses are called 'bonus-bonuses' internally. These are bonus offers that aren't mentioned on the sales page but show up in the access area for customers. Traditionally these are offers that don't meet the no strings attached requirement but pay a nice affiliate commission.

The line between bundle product and bonus offer can be a bit tricky to define. Traditionally a digital product from a blogger is considered a bundle product, but if it's from a "brand", it's a bonus offer. We've moved membership programs into the bundle itself, but I have mixed feelings about that.

Bonus partners are not obligated to promote but will receive the contributor-level commission (70%) if they want to.
