# Random factoids
**Things to consider when deciding on prizes** - Who do we want to motivate? What activities do we want to motivate? Do we want to do top seller prizes? Top converters? Top clicks/traffic? Random draws for all affiliates? Daily prizes or overall prizes? How much do you want to use for engagement in the affiliate group? What prizes are most motivating to this group of affiliates?

**Forward first affiliate email to contributors manually** - I send myself a copy and then forward it to all of the contributors (with none of my personal info/links and BCCing them, of course) as a check to make sure they're getting AC emails. I ask them to let me know if they didn't get it manually so we can check their settings.

**What is a micro-bundle?** Occasionally we'll pull together a small bundle of highly-targeted resources and promote them by email only. The contributors to that micro-bundle are also able to promote it to their list, but there's no big launch promotionâ€”it's just a short 3-day sale via email. For example, we've done an Instant Pot bundle and a Pinterest Mini Bundle. When we start working on those, we reach out to the people that have indicated yes on their contract or information form with the details and plans for that bundle, and then you have the opportunity to explicity opt in or out.


# How-to
**Approving FB group members** - We occasionally get customer & spam requests to join the FB group, so to try to minimize those, we ask new members three questions (1. Are you an affiliates? 2. What is your email address? 3. If you're not an affiliate, why do you want to join?). We only approve requests that answer these questions; we just delete the rest.

**Standard Templates** - Templates for most of the documents we use from bundle to bundle are found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5bEOUnPLa03YTVDSUpPTGhPUVE?usp=sharing. To use, right click and select **Make a copy**. Then move the file to the appropriate folder and replace the XXX with the bundle shortcode. It's important to check these every couple of months to make sure they're up to date as changes get made to the live versions over time.

**Create Zoom webinar** - Log into the customerservice@ultimatebundles.com Zoom account > My Webinars > Previous Webinars tab. Click on the most recent Affiliate Marketing Webinar and click *Schedule a webinar with these same settings*. Adjust Topic, Date, Alternative Host (use your email address). Click Schedule/Save. Copy registration URL from the new section that appears at the bottom. Make sure Email Settings include a reminder 1 day and 1 hour before the webinar. Change the branding to include the bundle's logo. Check registration page to make sure everything is correct.
