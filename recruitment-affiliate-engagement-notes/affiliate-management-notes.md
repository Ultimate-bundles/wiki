# Random factoids
**Things to consider when deciding on prizes** - Who do we want to motivate? What activities do we want to motivate? Do we want to do top seller prizes? Top converters? Top clicks/traffic? Random draws for all affiliates? Daily prizes or overall prizes? How much do you want to use for engagement in the affiliate group? What prizes are most motivating to this group of affiliates?

**Forward first affiliate email to contributors manually** - I send myself a copy and then forward it to all of the contributors (with none of my personal info/links and BCCing them, of course) as a check to make sure they're getting AC emails. I ask them to let me know if they didn't get it manually so we can check their settings.
# How-to
**Approving FB group members** - We occasionally get customer & spam requests to join the FB group, so to try to minimize those, we ask new members three questions (1. Are you an affiliates? 2. What is your email address? 3. If you're not an affiliate, why do you want to join?). We only approve requests that answer these questions; we just delete the rest.

**Standard Templates** - Templates for most of the documents we use from bundle to bundle are found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5bEOUnPLa03YTVDSUpPTGhPUVE?usp=sharing. To use, right click and select **Make a copy**. Then move the file to the appropriate folder and replace the XXX with the bundle shortcode. It's important to check these every couple of months to make sure they're up to date as changes get made to the live versions over time.
