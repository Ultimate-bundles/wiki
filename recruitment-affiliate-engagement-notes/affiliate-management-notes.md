# Random factoids
**Things to consider when deciding on prizes** - Who do we want to motivate? What activities do we want to motivate? Do we want to do top seller prizes? Top converters? Top clicks/traffic? Random draws for all affiliates? Daily prizes or overall prizes? How much do you want to use for engagement in the affiliate group? What prizes are most motivating to this group of affiliates?
# How-to
**Approving FB group members** - We occasionally get customer & spam requests to join the FB group, so to try to minimize those, we ask new members three questions (1. Are you an affiliates? 2. What is your email address? 3. If you're not an affiliate, why do you want to join?). We only approve requests that answer these questions; we just delete the rest.
