<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Top Affiliate Notes -->

# Header
**Abby Lawson		justagirlandherblog@gmail.com**
Has a variety of products across a range of topics; can be slow to respond, but promotes well.
PROD, would like to contribute
UHomB, would like to contribute
TGBTK, would like to contribute


**Alison Lumbatis		alison@getyourprettyon.com**
Offered the earlybird bonus for the 2018 Ultimate Homemaking Bundle; her products are a favorite of those customers.
UHomB, would like to contribute the 10 Ways to Get Out of the Makeup Rut or Rediscover Me 28 Day Challenge 


**Allison Lindstrom		HELLO@allisonlindstrom.com**
Allison is super savvy at business. She loves bundles but is careful to make sure it aligns with her goals as well.
TGBTK, wants to include her Blogging to Win ecourse again (last included in 2017)


**Amber Meyers		ameyers@theherbalacademy.com**
Amber runs the marketing for The Herbal Academy. She's hard to influence :), but they earn a lot from the bundles, so she's usually up for participating. 


**Amy Lynn Andrews		amylynnandrews@gmail.com**
Amy is careful about the things she says yes to. She only promotes if she a) fully believes in the product and b) has time to really dig into it herself so that she can make recommendations. Work to get her access to the products as early as possible.


**Angie Nelson		angie@asnvirtualservices.com**
We met Angie in person at Activate 2017. She focuses on WAH-type resources.


**Anna		khristal23@gmail.com**
Participated in the 2017 Work-at-Home Bundle. Nothing notable to share.


**Anne Bogel		modernmrsdarcy@gmail.com**
Anne is super busy and bundles are a small part of her strategy, but she usually jumps in with both feet for the Homemaking Bundle, especially when she has a product to include.


**Arabah Joy		arabahjoy@gmail.com**
Arabah, or AJ, often shows up on the leaderboard for other JV launches, and she has a lot of offers to choose from. We frequently offer her super affiliate status when she doesn't have a product for the current bundle.


**Becky Rapinchuk		clean.mama@yahoo.com**
Becky has been doing bundles since 2017 and the Homemaking is the best fit for her audience. She is a top seller and should be given priority for that bundle since her topic (cleaning/organizing) is over-saturated.


**Becky Mansfield		yourmodernfamily@gmail.com**
Becky is great at marketing but not all of her products meet our quality requirements, so they should be reviewed carefully.


**Beth Learn		beth@fit2b.us**
Beth is one of our longest running affiliates. She can be abrupt in her conversation style but responds well if you need to push back against her requests.


**Matt & Betsy Jabs		social@diynatural.com**
The Jabs took a step back from bundles for a couple of years because of the stress of bundle week, but I've seen them pop up a couple times since they told me that, so it may be worth reconnecting with them to see if we can get them really reengaged.


**Bob Lotich		boblotich@gmail.com**
Bob & Ryan are good friends. He participates in both the Blogging & Homemaking space and is currently helping Caroline recruit for Personal Finance.


**Brett Kelly		brett@brettkelly.org**
Brett did well on the original CYCSB sale but hasn't been very responsive since then. Would be worth trying to reengage him.


**Brian Dixon		brian@dixonagency.org**
Brian's business model has changed drastically. He was helping bloggers launch courses and other products but built himself a bit of a negative reputation (he details this in his upcoming book). I don't think he works with individual bloggers anymore but may have products of his own to contribute in the future or could be a good super affiliate.


**Caitlin Pyle		caitlin@bcpmediainc.com**
Caitlin is the owner of Proofread Anywhere and Work-at-Home School and is a genius marketer. However, she's gone a bit off the rails on social media since October (one could argue that she's exhibiting bipolar or other mental illness warning signs). I don't think we should work or interact with her until whatever is happening sorts itself out because she turns quickly on people with all kinds of crazy accusations.


**Carisa Hinson		1plus1plus1equals1@gmail.com**
Carisa focuses on the family-focused bundles and is always a top performer for UHomB. She (and Jolanthe Erb) tend to get really worked up over people claiming their bonuses if they aren't on her ledger.


**Carly Campbell / Carleen Hurst		myintentionallife@outlook.com**
I think she goes by Carly Campbell publicly, but her correspondence in my inbox is under Carleen. She's a bit of a hot mess (by her own admission) with 2 tiny kids who are about 15 months apart, but her content is top notch. 
TGBTK, super affiliate at a minimum, may have a product to include
