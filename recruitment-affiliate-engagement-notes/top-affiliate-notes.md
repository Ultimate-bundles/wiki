<!-- SUBTITLE: wo quick summary of Top Affiliate Notes -->

# Header
**Abby Lawson		justagirlandherblog@gmail.com**
Has a variety of products across a range of topics; can be slow to respond, but promotes well.
PROD, would like to contribute
UHomB, would like to contribute
TGBTK, would like to contribute


**Alison Lumbatis		alison@getyourprettyon.com**
Offered the earlybird bonus for the 2018 Ultimate Homemaking Bundle; her products are a favorite of those customers.
UHomB, would like to contribute the 10 Ways to Get Out of the Makeup Rut or Rediscover Me 28 Day Challenge 


**Allison Lindstrom		HELLO@allisonlindstrom.com**
Allison is super savvy at business. She loves bundles but is careful to make sure it aligns with her goals as well.
TGBTK, wants to include her Blogging to Win ecourse again (last included in 2017)


**Amber Meyers		ameyers@theherbalacademy.com**
Amber runs the marketing for The Herbal Academy. She's hard to influence :), but they earn a lot from the bundles, so she's usually up for participating. 


**Amy Lynn Andrews		amylynnandrews@gmail.com**
Amy is careful about the things she says yes to. She only promotes if she a) fully believes in the product and b) has time to really dig into it herself so that she can make recommendations. Work to get her access to the products as early as possible.


**Amy Blevins		amyb@homeschoolencouragement.com**
Amy is a long-time contributor and almost always wants to participate in the UHomB at a minimum. We've had a lot of email issues with her account, so it's worth reaching out to her directly about being a contributor or super affiliate for bundles in that space.


**Angie Nelson		angie@asnvirtualservices.com**
We met Angie in person at Activate 2017. She focuses on WAH-type resources.


**Anna		khristal23@gmail.com**
Participated in the 2017 Work-at-Home Bundle. Nothing notable to share.


**Anne Bogel		modernmrsdarcy@gmail.com**
Anne is super busy and bundles are a small part of her strategy, but she usually jumps in with both feet for the Homemaking Bundle, especially when she has a product to include.


**Arabah Joy		arabahjoy@gmail.com**
Arabah, or AJ, often shows up on the leaderboard for other JV launches, and she has a lot of offers to choose from. We frequently offer her super affiliate status when she doesn't have a product for the current bundle.


**Becky Rapinchuk		clean.mama@yahoo.com**
Becky has been doing bundles since 2017 and the Homemaking is the best fit for her audience. She is a top seller and should be given priority for that bundle since her topic (cleaning/organizing) is over-saturated.


**Becky Mansfield		yourmodernfamily@gmail.com**
Becky is great at marketing but not all of her products meet our quality requirements, so they should be reviewed carefully.


**Beth Learn		beth@fit2b.us**
Beth is one of our longest running affiliates. She can be abrupt in her conversation style but responds well if you need to push back against her requests.


**Matt & Betsy Jabs		social@diynatural.com**
The Jabs took a step back from bundles for a couple of years because of the stress of bundle week, but I've seen them pop up a couple times since they told me that, so it may be worth reconnecting with them to see if we can get them really reengaged.


**Bob Lotich		boblotich@gmail.com**
Bob & Ryan are good friends. He participates in both the Blogging & Homemaking space and is currently helping Caroline recruit for Personal Finance.


**Brett Kelly		brett@brettkelly.org**
Brett did well on the original CYCSB sale but hasn't been very responsive since then. Would be worth trying to reengage him.


**Brian Dixon		brian@dixonagency.org**
Brian's business model has changed drastically. He was helping bloggers launch courses and other products but built himself a bit of a negative reputation (he details this in his upcoming book). I don't think he works with individual bloggers anymore but may have products of his own to contribute in the future or could be a good super affiliate.


**Caitlin Pyle		caitlin@bcpmediainc.com**
Caitlin is the owner of Proofread Anywhere and Work-at-Home School and is a genius marketer. However, she's gone a bit off the rails on social media since October (one could argue that she's exhibiting bipolar or other mental illness warning signs). I don't think we should work or interact with her until whatever is happening sorts itself out because she turns quickly on people with all kinds of crazy accusations.


**Carisa Hinson		1plus1plus1equals1@gmail.com**
Carisa focuses on the family-focused bundles and is always a top performer for UHomB. She (and Jolanthe Erb) tend to get really worked up over people claiming their bonuses if they aren't on her ledger.


**Carly Campbell / Carleen Hurst		myintentionallife@outlook.com**
I think she goes by Carly Campbell publicly, but her correspondence in my inbox is under Carleen. She's a bit of a hot mess (by her own admission) with 2 tiny kids who are about 15 months apart, but her content is top notch. 
TGBTK, super affiliate at a minimum, may have a product to include


**Caroline Allen 		Caroline@deborahandco.com**
Caroline is one of our longest running contributors and has also partnered with us as a bonus partner in the past. She is a Lilla Rose consultant at a fairly high level, and I think focuses more on that business now. Her husband, Sean, is a graphic designer and they sometimes submit printable products that he's created.


**Caroline Makepeace		cazcraig@ytravelblog.com**
Caroline, or Caz, and her husband Craig are Australian travel bloggers currently living in the U.S. on a permanent resident visa. They just set off for an RV tour around the states with their two girls. They're not always super communicative but do well on business-related bundles. Some of their "mindset" products veer a bit into the woo-wooey, so it's important to carefully review them.


**Chris Dalziel		joybileefarm@gmail.com**
Chris is one of our most loyal contributors in the health space, and she typically creates and launches products with both the UHLB & HEO. Her communication style is very direct and it can feel like she's upset when she's really just sharing info or asking a question.
HEOSB, creating new course specifically for this bundle
UHLB, creating new course specifically for this bundle


**Cole Joseph		cole@colesclassroom.com**
Cole has participated in all of the UPB sales. The last sale did not perform well for him at all, and he was pretty upset about needing to extend his coupon code for the flash sale. He has said that he's not participating in ANY bundles moving forward.


**Courtney Slazinick		clickitupanotch@gmail.com**
Courney is a loyal affiliate and contributor who has been part of each of the UPBs (and maybe a UHomB as well). In 2018, she partnered with us pretty heavily to create the marketing direction for the bundle and recorded both the prelauch and sales video as well. 5DayDeals is anxious to recruit her to their bundles, and with us pulling back from that space in 2019, she may begin to work with them. 
mini-UPB, would like to participate


**Crystal		moneysavingmom@gmail.com**
Crystal seemed to buy in to the bundles more in 2019 but passed on both the HMPB & UPB for 2019. It's always worth sending an email to her and her Director of Marketing, Brian (brian@moneysavingmom.com) about future bundles that relate to families, personal development, personal finance, working at home, or blogging.


**Dana White		aslobcomesclean@gmail.com**
Dana enthusiastically submitted her product 3 different times for this year's UHomB. Sometimes I worry just a little bit about the quality of her products. She's a valuable contributor, but her products are not the best we see.
UHomB, would like to include the 5 Day Clutter Shakedown


**Darren Rowse		darrenrowse@gmail.com**
Darren became our top-selling affiliate *ever* with the 2017 UPB, where he earned more than $118K in commission. His list didn't perform as well in 2018, and frankly I think it was oversaturation because he also promoted 5DD's 2017 bundle in October. However, he's still an enthusiastic participant to both the UPB & TGBTK. His blogging products, surprisingly, can feel a bit out of date when compared to some of the other products in the bundle, but the authority he brings to the table + his sales make him a valuable contributor. His Director of Marketing is Laney Galligan, and she's the one you'll talk to most often (laney@digital-photography-school.com or laney@problogger.com).


**David Molnar		david@davidmolnar.com**
We partnered with David for the recruitment, vision & sales video for the 2017 UPB. He did a great job but the bundle didn't perform as well as expected, and it wasn't a relationship either of us wanted to continue in that way. He did, however, still participate in the 2018 UPB, and it's worth reaching out to him for future bundles as well.


**Dr. Eric Zielinski		Affiliate@drericz.com**
Eric, or Dr. Z, is a savvy business person but can be hard to work with for bundles because he's reluctant to include his best products but only wants to include products with 3rd party registration on his site, so he often tries to slip partial products or lead magnets in. He will often agree to participate and then market to only tiny segment of his list. 
HEOSB & UHLB


**Emily Baker		emily@hopeink.com**
Emily is the owner of HopeInk, our most active bonus partner, but she also does well marketing the bundles to her list. She can be very direct in asking for what she wants (often extra emails sent out to remind customers to redeem their bonuses), but is actually really great to work with.
UHomB, possible PROD BP?


**Erin Odom		thehumbledhomemaker@gmail.com**
Erin & her husband Will co-founded UB with Ryan & Stephanie and sold their share of the company back to the Langfords in...2015? I think after the UHomB that year. Erin is pretty much guaranteed super affiliate status in any bundle, and we prioritize her NEW product submissions as well. The last few years have been hard for them as far as balancing homeschooling, the baby & the blog, so she often flakes out during a bundle promotion, unfortunately.

 		
**Gena Suarez		publisher@theoldschoolhouse.com**
I actually think Gena & her husband sold The Old Schoolhouse to someone else. It may be worth reaching out to see who's in  charge now and if they're still interested in participating in bundles!


**Genevieve Howland		mama@mamanatural.com, michael@mamanatural.com**
Michael/Mike is Genevieve's husband, and he is our main contact for most bundles, although Genevieve is the public face of their business. (Interesting note: a year or two ago, they legally changed their last name from Pazdan to Howland.) They have been rising in the leaderboards each bundle, and they typically come through with a big promotion even when they seem quiet or not as responsive on email.


**Haley Stewart		Haley.s.stewart@gmail.com**
Haley has contributed to and promoted both the Healthy Living Bundle & Homemaking Bundle. I think her audience is a bit more loyal to the UHomB, and last year she mentioned that Daniel (her husband) was working on an ebook about road trips with kids that would be a great addition! She always has really creative promotional ideas, so she's a good one to watch during a bundle as well!


**Heather Dessinger		heather@mommypotamus.com**
Mommypotamus was recently bought by Wellness Mama. I don't fully understand whether they're now running things together or who our main contact should be, but both of them have pulled back a bit from bundles recently. Stephanie would have more details about their business model and how we should approach them for future opportunities.


**Helene Sula		helene@heleneinbetween.com**
Helene is a great affiliate in that she's enthusiastic about selling the bundle and sells enough to make it onto the top affiliates list, but her work can be so-so, so it's important to carefully proof anything she submits, and I don't think you should be afraid to decline to include something if the quality is not there.


**Jami Balmet		jami@youngwifesguide.com**
I left this on here because it made me laugh when I came across it. :) What I would say: "Jami is a business savvy blogger running a thriving business on the side. She doesn't participate in every bundle, but when she does participate, she jumps in with both feet!"


**Jamie Martin		jamie@simplehomeschool.net**


**Jennifer Hoffman		jennifer@healthymoving.com**
Like Beth, Jennifer is one of our longest running contributors. I think she's participated in every Homemaking & Healthy Living bundle since the beginning, first as a bonus partner and then as a contributor. We've had some trouble with communication in the past year or so, where her replies aren't coming through and it feels like she's just ignoring us. Pinging her on FB is a good way to get in touch if you don't hear back.


**Jennifer Roskamp		theintentionalmomblog@gmail.com**
Jennifer is a member of Ruth's "inner circle" mastermind and mom to...7? 8? She has a unique email strategy that includes daily plain-text emails with realistic stories about her family life and a P.S. link or promotion at the end of each one, and she sells a fair number of bundles that way. The last Healthy Living Bundle didn't perform we


**Jennifer Mason		workingathomeschool@gmail.com**
Jennifer recently rebranded from Working at Homeschool to The Well-Planned Kitchen with more of a focus on meal planning and especially keto & THM. She's got an amazing following but is very particular about what she promotes (which is what makes her promotions so effective, I'm sure).


**Jessica Fisher		jessica@lifeasmom.com**
Jessica used to be *extremely* enthusiastic about bundles, with a goal of making it on the top 10 leaderboard. I think her competitive nature (and maybe insecurity) has made her pull back since she hasn't been able to hit that goal, and it's discouraging to her. That said, she has already said she's in for the UHomB, so this is a great opportunity to encourage her and help her set a goal that she can achieve and feel good about.
UHomB, would like to contribute a 1-hr meal planning and prep workshop


**Jessi Fearon		jessica.fearon@gmail.com**
You know, I can't really think of anything that stands out about Jessi. Her speciality is personal finance, but the fact that she's on the leaderboard and I don't know her better tells me there's opportunity there! 
PERSOFIN, budgeting is her specialty, so we should definitely reach out about that one


**Josh Dunlop		josh@expertphotography.com**
He's already emailed asking about dates for the photography bundle this year, so he's definitely worth reaching out too.


**Kalyn Brooke		kalynbrooke@gmail.com**
Kalyn and her husband were planning to sell their home and tour full-time in an RV, but I think the process is taking longer than expect. They'll be documenting their travels here: https://www.facebook.com/openroading. She's super sweet and talented at both product creation and affiliate marketing.
PROD, would like to be a super affiliate
UHomB, would like to contribute again


**Katelyn	James	Katelyn@katelynjames.com**
She was due with her daughter during the UPB2017 and probably didn't even hit her sales potential, and her preroll was one of my favorite ever! That said, her focus is really on training professional photographers to help them grow their business, so I'm not sure there's a fit for her this year. (And she declined to participate last year because of timing.)


**Katie Kimball		katie@kitchenstewardship.com**
Katie is a member of Ryan & Stephanie's family mastermind group and has been a loyal contributor & affiliate from the beginning. She's direct & blunt but wants what's best for everyone, so she's a great one to bounce ideas off of (although we don't always agree with her conclusions). She seemed a bit stretched in 2018 and was a little harder to pin down on things, but don't feel bad about following up with her. She likes to hop on Zoom rather than chat back and forth on email. :) 


**Katie Wells		katie@wellnessmama.com**
This Katie is also a member of the Langford's mastermind and they are close friends. Her last name is really Spears, but she carefully guards that online and goes by Katie Wells. Her husband, Seth Spears, specializes in SEO and has purchased multiple sites in this space over the past few years (Crunchy Betty, Mama & Baby Love, Keeper of the Home). They're VERY business savvy. When they promote bundles, they sell a lot, but they've pulled back quite a bit over the past year, and Ryan & Stephanie don't want to use their friendship to influence that too much.


**Kayse Pratt		kayse.pratt@gmail.com**
During the 2015 Homemaking Bundle, Kayse too everyone by surprise with 15% conversion rates (which were pretty unheard of at that point) and ending up near the top of the leaderboard despite a relatively small audience. She continues to make the UHomB one of her main promotions of the year, but has also done some pretty cool stuff like launching a physical planner this year. She's moved all of her products to "ecourse" formats that require registration on her site, but I think she understands that the amount of content has to justify us setting it up that way for customers.


**Kelly McNelis 	kelly@newleafwellness.biz**
Kelly writes & publishes freezer meal cookbooks and has built a HUGE business around them. The timing of recent UHomB/UHLB bundles hasn't worked with her own promotions, but she's interested in contributing her ebook course to the TGBTK, which I think would be a great addition!
TGBTK, would like to contribute an ecourse about marketing ebooks


**Kelly Holmes		kelly@stickyblogging.com**
Kelly has both a lifestyle blog & a blogging blog. She did well during the TGBTK, but I don't think there's a lot of loyalty there, and it may be worth cultivating that relationship in 2019.


**Kresha Faber		kresha@nourishingjoy.com**
Oh, Kresha. :) We love Kresha, and she's personal friends with Ryan & Stephanie. That said, with the addition of her new baby, she's had a really hard time meeting deadlines and left us scrambling at the last minute at least twice in 2018. We absolutely have a place for her in bundles (and she has a lot of creative marketing ideas to learn from!), but I would not accept a product that wasn't 100% complete in the future just to avoid those sticky situations.


**Kyle Schultz		kyle@shultzphotoschool.com**
Kyle has a lot of great products specifically for moms/parents learning to shoot their families, and he'd be a great addition to the new photography mini bundle. He's a really nice guy and seems pretty loyal to UB at this point.


**Laura Coppinger		laura@heavenlyhomemakers.com**
I feel like Laura's enthusiasm for bundles has waned a bit in 2018, and I can't quite pinpoint why. She still agrees to participate, but we don't see her sell as many bundles or go as "all-in". This could be because her family has started fostering little ones (I believe they have one preschooler on a foster-to-adoption path and recently accepted a baby as well) and they're back in those "busy" years with little ones underfoot. It may be worth seeing if there's a way to get her to buy in more, although I respond to her email newsletters a fair bit, so I don't think the issue is engagement on our end.

 
**Laura Smith		iheartplanners@gmail.com**
Laura is unassuming and easy to underestimate, but she is a marketing genius! (I also love her genuine enthusiasm for life—guaranteed that she laughs within 30 seconds of starting a conversation with her!). We met her in person at Activate 2017 and saw her again in 2018, and her success with summits & funnels is one of the impetus behind our decision to do the PERSOFIN conference model. Her business is exploding, so it can be hard to get in touch with her, but I haven't seen any indication that she's not interested in working with us, so it's worth following up until you hear back.


**Lauren Tamm		themilitarywifeandmom@gmail.com**
We don't hear from Lauren a lot and have never made much of a personal connection, but she's a loyal & regular contributor to the UHomB (usually in partnership with Rachel Norman). Her husband (and their family) have been stationed in Japan for many years but recently came back stateside.


**Lea Harris		leaharrisUEOS@gmail.com**
Lea is a controversial figure in the EO space, and I think she likes it that way. :) She takes a hard stance against internal usage of EOs and for the conservative dilution of many oils, and many (Eric Z comes to mind) think that she undermines the actual science in the area. Interesting side note: Heather Dessinger is a huge Lea fan and takes much of her approach to oils from Lea's handbook. Some of Lea's products are wonderful and others are meh, and she hasn't sold nearly as many bundles recently (FB shut down her old, very big group, which affected her reach pretty significantly), so don't be afraid to push back. Personally: She's open about leaving an abusive marriage (her ex-husband is in jail), and a year or so ago she met a guy on FB and moved to Minnesota (?) to get married. 


**Lena Gott		lena@whatmommydoes.com**
Lena flies a bit under the radar but has really great blogging products. I think her goal last year was to swoop from under the radar and top the TGBTK leaderboard, which didn't quite happen. I don't know if that's left her feeling discouraged about bundles or not, but she's definitely one we want on board for the quality & authority of her products!


**Leslie		leslie@lambertslately.com**
Leslie is a meal planning/recipe contributor who doesn't make many waves but consistently sells bundles. I think there's probably opportunity here to nurture a stronger relationship with her!


**Maria Emmerich		craigmaria@gmail.com**
Maria is well known outside of blog circles for her keto books & cookbooks. I mostly communicate with her husband Craig. He's not super chatty but always seems excited to jump onboard for a bundle, and they consistently promote. They have two little boys who were adopted from Ethiopia, and they love outdoor adventures. (Side note: Maria has the most amazing photos and videos on her Facebook page of her paddleboarding with a mama & baby humpback whale. They're just breathtaking!)


**Mark Timm		Mark@ziglarfamily.com**
Mark is one of Ryan's best friends. He owns/runs Ziglar Family, which is the organization dedicated to keeping Zig Ziglar's legacy & words alive through books, memberships, etc. He and his wife (Ann) also purchased Keeper of the Home from Stephanie several years ago but have since sold it. They are pretty much guaranteed super affiliate status for any bundle they request but didn't promote much in 2018. Jen Truitt is our main contact at Ziglar Family: jen@ziglarfamily.com


**Melissa Ringstaff		melissaringstaff@avirtuouswoman.org**
Melissa does really well with product sales on her own and can be a bit hard to nail down; it's worth nurturing a relationship with her to see if we can get a stronger commitment from her for future bundles! 


**Melissa Norris		melissaknorris@juno.com**
Melissa is a healthy living / homesteading blogger who also specializes in canning. We've had issues in the past with her submitting partial courses, so that's something to watch for. She doesn't participate in EVERY  bundle, but usually joins for 1 every 12-18 months.


**Mique Provost		info@thirtyhandmadedays.com**
Mique first joined us as an affiliate during the 2017 UHomB and jumped quickly on the leaderboard. I don't think she's done as well since then, in part because she hasn't promoted as much as the first time. She'd be a good one to get onboard and engaged, though! 


**Missy		missy@howdoesshe.com**
Missy has only participated as an affiliate, and we haven't even had many conversations. Cultivating a relationship with How Does She should be a priority in 2019. 


**Monica Froese		monica.n.froese@gmail.com**
Monica is about as direct as they come, but she's also really sweet and kind. She has one daughter in elementary school plus another baby girl and has been open about her strugges with PPD since the birth of the baby. The TGBTK is an important part of her strategy each year, but she's also really strategic in which product she includes and the timing of mini-bundles (like the BPMB). She came *so close* to being the top converter last October but was beat out at the last minute, which I think was really discouraging for her. 


**Myquillyn Smith		nestergirl@gmail.com**
Myquillyn (known as The Nester) is super conservative about what projects she works on, but she has been a great partner in the past, and it would be worth investigating whether there are additional home decor resources she can add to the Homemaking Bundle. She also partners with Brian Dixon on hope * writers, and there may be an opportunity there for TGBTK.

**Rachel Norman		amotherfarfromhome@gmail.com**
Rachel is another dynamite marketer who I think sometimes flies under the radar. She's incredible at product creation and affiliate marketing, and we always learn by watching her.
UHomB, would like to contribute again


**Renee Harris		renee@hardlotion.com**
Renee has participated numerous times in the UHomB, UHLB & HEOSB as a contributor and/or bonus partner. She's professional and skilled, and while she doesn't have the largest audience, she's a valuable and engaged affiliate. 


**Robert		support@oil-testimonials.com**
Robert runs an essential oils forum of sorts. He is incredibly blunt and pushy, and while he's fairly likable on Zoom, he's decidedly not likable by email. (Past comments include: "Oddly enough, none of the banner images created for Herbs & Essential Oils show any bottles of essential oils. There is one image with two blurry dark glass bottles, but not in the size most people would associate with essential oils.  Can you have your graphic designer come up with something better?  While they are at it, pixel sizes of 500x300 work  best for me. Here is one that I have no idea what it represents.... its so dark and blurry.  Who comes up with these?") but that's just one example of many. He's quieted down in 2018 but did sell a fair number of bundles before that, so I'll leave it up to you whether it's worth rekindling the relationship.


**Rosalee de la Foret		rosalee@herbalremediesadvice.org**
HEOSB, would like to contribute


**Rosemarie Groner		busybudgeter@gmail.com**


**Ruth Soukup		ruth@livingwellspendingless.com**

PROD, super affiliate
UHomB, would like to contribute
UHLB, super affiliate
TGBTK, would like to contribute if she can finish her product in time


**Victoria Osborn		creativehomekeeper@gmail.com**


**Wardee Harmon		wardeh@traditionalcookingschool.com**
Wardee was a core part of the UB team in the beginning, handling the IFS setup and helping with a lot of the marketing decisions. She pulled back several years ago to focus on her business (Traditional Cooking School), which she now runs with her daughter, Haniya. That said, Wardee continues to be our most loyal contributor/affiliate in the health space, and it's always fun to watch and learn from her promotions!


**Will Falconer		drfalconer@VitalAnimal.com**
Will is a natural vet who participates in the HEO & UHLB. He has talked about creating a product around using essential oils for pets or natural remedies for pets but hasn't yet; some of his product ideas are TOO specific and might feel out of place without a broader "natural pet care" category. He can be very direct, which sometimes feels pushy, but he's a really nice guy!
