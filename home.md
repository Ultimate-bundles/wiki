# Wiki Overview
Hey all, welcome to the wiki.  

The point of this platform is to record any information that really should live somewhere that the rest of the team can access it.  This extends to things like contact details, technical decisions, hosting details, sales records, etc.  Anything that has historical significance and needs a place to live should get documented down here :)

## Style Guide
These are the *very* rough guidelines for styling your articles and keeping the look and feel consistent.

**Headings**
H1 = One per article to address the theme
H2 = Main theme dividers
H3 = Sub-headers

Here's an example:


```text
H1: Facebook Ads
    H2: How to create Facebook ads
        H3: Setting up ad groups
        H3: Split testing
    H2: How to optimize Facebook ads
        H3: Best tricks for tweaking ads
    H2: How to measure Facebook ads 
        H3: Adding results to Google sheet
```
