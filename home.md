# Getting Started Guide
Welcome to the Ultimate Bundle wiki.  Don't panic, there's a lot of information here to help you navigate the wiki and create your own articles.

## Purpose of the wiki

The point of this platform is to record any information that really should live somewhere that the rest of the team can access it.  This extends to things like contact details, technical decisions, hosting details, sales records, etc.  Anything that has historical significance and needs a place to live should get documented here.

## Basics of the wiki
1. The wiki is divided into Wikis and Pages. Inside a wiki, you can create a hierarchy of pages, by creating pages inside other pages. This feature is called **Nested Pages.** Nested Pages can be created when naming your article by adding a directory name before the article name, like this `management-documents/my-article-name`, where `management-documents` would be the wiki and `my-article-name` would be the nested page.
2. Whenever you want to modify a page, click on the "Edit" button, make your changes and save the page. The modified page now replaces the previous version. 
3. On the left navigation menu, you can select settings to change your password and profile details.  If you can't access this page, you may have limited permissions and will need to talk to one of the technical guys
4. At the top of the page you'll find a search bar that will let you quickly look for an existing article
5. While in a wiki or nested page, the left navigation menu will have a number of anchor links that you can click to jump to corresponding points in the content.
