<!-- TITLE: Getting Started Guide -->

Welcome to the Ultimate Bundle wiki.  Don't panic, there's a lot of information here to help you navigate the wiki and create your own articles.

# Purpose of the wiki

The point of this platform is to record any information that really should live somewhere that the rest of the team can access it.  This extends to things like contact details, technical decisions, hosting details, sales records, etc.  Anything that has historical significance and needs a place to live should get documented here.

# Basics of using the wiki
**Creating pages** You can create a new page by clicking the `+create` button in the top right corner. 

**Creating folders** To create a folder you need to add the `folder name`, foward slash, then `page` as illustrated below.  You can't create empty folders so they need to be made at the time of saving pages, for example:
`management-documents/my-page-name`, where `management-documents` would be the folder and `my-page-name` would be the page.

**Editing pages** Whenever you want to modify a page, click on the "Edit" button, make your changes and save the page. The modified page now replaces the previous version. 

**Change user settings** On the left navigation menu, you can select settings to change your password and profile details.  If you can't access this page, you may have limited permissions and will need to talk to one of the technical guys

**Searching for pages** At the top of the page you'll find a search bar that will let you quickly look for an existing article.

**Navigating a page** While in a wiki or nested page, the left navigation menu will have a number of anchor links that you can click to jump to corresponding points in the content.

# How to use markdown 
This wiki uses a special kind of text formatting called markdown.  Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax.
