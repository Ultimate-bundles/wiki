<!-- TITLE: Postaffiliatepro -->

# Overview
PostAffilaitePro (PAP) serves as our affiliate management platform.  It also hosts the promotional content and sales statistics for affiliates to access in the lead up to and during a sale.

# What it does for us

PAP allows us to create "campaigns" which have commission levels and particular product IDs.  This effectively lets us keep track of how many sales affiliates have made, how much revenue has been generated from those sales, and how much of the sale is paid out as a commission.  When ever we need to know something about an affiliate's activity, PAP is the place to go.

When we're investigating affiliate issues, PAP allows us to search for a particular user and log into their account to see what has been happening.

# What it does for our affiliates
PAP is the central location for all sales stats for an affiliate.  When they want to see their clicks, sales, or revenue, it is all hosted in PAP.

In the lead up to a sale, PAP offers an interface to access links, banners, swipe copy and other promotional assets.
