<!-- TITLE: Access Area -->

# Overview
The access area serves bundle content to our customers.  Behind the WordPress interface lives a bunch of custom code (Laravel, which is a PHP framework if you know stuff about code) that runs a bunch of logic to create user accounts, assign them to particular bundles of content, restrict their access based on date ranges, and a number of other actions.

This area is where we load all of the content for a bundle as it becomes available.  The WordPress interface has been customized to reflect this; there is a Page section for creating bundles, one for uploading content, another for the bonus content, and so on.  There is quite a lot of functionality in this area and some of it is pretty technical and will not be covered in this overview.

On the front end of the access site the customers (and administrators) can access bundle content.  The portal is split into two major sections; content and bonuses.  By default the bonuses page loads first.
