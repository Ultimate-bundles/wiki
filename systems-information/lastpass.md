<!-- TITLE: Lastpass -->

# Overview
LastPass is a password management system.  The general idea is that having one master password is the easiest to remember, and will get you into the LP system.  Every other platform has a super strong 16 digital password that is stored within LastPass.

What this means in the real world is that you'll need to install the LastPass Chrome or FireFox extension (just search for it) and then sign into LP with the correct credentials.  Once you're in, there will be a little LP symbol next to the login fields of any website that requires a password.  The login details can be prepopulated by clicking the little symbol and picking the right credentials.
