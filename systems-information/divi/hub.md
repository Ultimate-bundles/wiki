<!-- TITLE: Divi -->
# Overview
Divi is a WordPress theme, but it's also what we refer to when we're talking about our webpage building tool.

Ultimate Bundles creates the same kind of web pages for each sale.  In general these are the kinds of pages we create;
* Sales page
* Upsell page
* Coming soon page
* Thank you page
* Landing page
* Success page
* Brochure pages (for ultimatebundles.com)

When you get into the Divi backend you'll notice that each of these webpages has it's own WordPress page type on the sidebar.  The process for creating a page is the same regardless of which page type you're working with.  

# Naming conventions
When creating a new page, this is the general naming convention (although it does change from time to time):

`Bundlecode+Year Description`.  i.e.
HMPB2019 Sales Page
UHOMB2018 OTO (one time offer)
UHLB2019 Health book lead magnet

# Redirects
The Divi/WordPress install has some custom functionality to allow us to redirect to different pages based on date range.  If the present time/date isn't current then Divi will redirect the traffic somewhere else.  This is useful for sales when we want early bird pages or sales page to automatically redirect to somewhere else, or when we want the sale to open and the "Coming Soon" page to automatically turn into the sales page.
