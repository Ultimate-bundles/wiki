<!-- TITLE: Infusionsoft -->

## History
Infusionsoft was the primary CRM/affiliate management system for Ultimate Bundles between 2014 and mid 2018.  Due to an array of ongoign technical issues, a lack of decent support and a poorly designed interface, we decided to move to PostAffiliatePro and Ontraport as our primary affilaite and CRM systems.

## Backed up data
This wiki article will detail the information that we've extracted from Infusionsoft and how to easily access that information.  Infusionsoft reports will be extracted and saved in Google sheets and organized in Google drive.  Descriptions of the kind of information we've exported and how to access it will live in this wiki.

## Reporting considerations
Since 2013 there have been a lot of sales.  Until recently most of them haven't been documented particularly well.  This means capturing all sale dates in reports will be very difficult.  For instance, running a report for UHOMB2015 transactions will show bundles being sold across different parts of the year (pre-sale, regular sale, flash sale).  

The product naming structure has not always been consistent and there are a number of products that have ambigulous names and may not actually be tied to a sale.  Whether to include these products or not in the reports for a particular sale has been made off educated guesses.

When running the affiliate ledger report, Infusionsoft spits out every affiliate and their balance.  There doesn't seem to be a way to limit the report to just affiliates that took part in a sale without filtering the data manually through Excel/Google Sheets.

## Reporting requirements before shutting down Infusionsoft
* List of past purchasers
* List of affiliates
* Affiliate commissions for each financial year
* Transactions for each bundle campaign
* Sales made by affiliates
* Affiliate leaderboards
* Refund reports broken down by year
* Total campaign revenue
* List of bundles, products and prices
* Categorization of products, bumps, upsells
* Sales grouped by affiliate
* Conversion data per sale
