<!-- TITLE: Infusionsoft -->

## History
Infusionsoft was the primary CRM/affiliate management system for Ultimate Bundles between 2014 and mid 2018.  Due to an array of ongoign technical issues, a lack of decent support and a poorly designed interface, we decided to move to PostAffiliatePro and Ontraport as our primary affilaite and CRM systems.
